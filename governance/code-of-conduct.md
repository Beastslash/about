# Beastslash Code of Conduct
The **Beastslash Code of Conduct** applies to all Beastslash community members, including employees, interns, contractors, players, users, and guests. Each product and service may have its own specific rules that complement the Beastslash Code of Conduct.

## Global rules
### 1. Play by the rules
This means you shouldn't cheat in our games or disrupt services for anyone else. You can mod our games to make them more accessible and enjoyable for you, but don't ruin the experience for other people. 

### 2. Be yourself
You can roleplay as fictional characters, but don't maliciously impersonate anyone. If you are parodying someone, make it clear that you are not actually that person.

### 3. Be kind to each other
Do not attack anyone based on their character.

### 4. Share with care
Do not reveal or threaten to reveal anyone's protected personal information.

Protected personal information includes:
* private addresses and GPS coordinates,
* government-issued identification cards,
* bank information,
* non-public contact information, and
* media featuring a person without their explicit permission.

Exercise caution when revealing your own personal information on the Internet.

### 5. Stay safe off-platform
We do not actively look for violations of the Beastslash Code of Conduct outside of Beastslash products; however, certain egregious or dangerous off-platform behavior — such as stalking, sexual harassment, physical harm, and grooming — may cause us to react. 

## Reprecussions
Reprecussions for violating the Beastslash Code of Conduct can include:
* us telling you to knock it off,
* account suspensions and terminations,
* disqualification from special events,
* feature restrictions, such as chat mutes and world publishing bans,
* random username and display name generation,
* removal from special programs or groups, and
* other types of sanctions that we deem appropriate.
